                    <h4>Who is Cristiano Ronaldo?</h4>
                    <p>“ My father always taught me that when you help other people, then God will give you double. And that's what has really happened to me. When I have helped other people who are in need, God has helped me more.”
                    <br><br>Who is Cristiano Ronaldo? He is a Portuguese professional footballer, plays forward position for Spanish club Real Madrid, is the captain of Portugal national team, is often ranked as the best player in the world, and was named by Forbes in 2016 "the world's best paid athlete". He was born on Tuesday February 5th 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal.
                    <br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo possesses a great talent for creativity and self expression, typical of many accomplished writers, poets, actors and musicians. He is also witty, owns the gift for gab, and savors the limelight.
                    <br><br>Ronaldo is optimistic and masters the resilience to overcome many setbacks. Thanks to his gift for self expression, he can be the life of the party, and the center of attention. When used constructively, Cristiano's talent for self expression can be a great inspiration force in the world, uplifting others, and bringing much success and happiness to him. However, Cristiano Ronaldo could easily squander his talent by becoming a social butterfly.
                    <br><br>His talent for the expressive arts is so abundant that Cristiano may well have felt drawn to becoming an artist while still very young. However, these artistic abilities can only be enhanced through discipline and commitment to the true development of his talent. In other words, creativity is the gift that can give Cristiano Ronaldo the comfort and luxury he desires, but not without continual focus and discipline.
                    <br>Cristiano Ronaldo is emotional and vulnerable. He can be generous to a fault, but when hurt, he withdraws into a cloud of silence, eventually emerging from his reticence with jokes and laughter that cover up his true feelings
